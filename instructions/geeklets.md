Geeklets
========
A Geeklet file is just XML containing some Shell commands and design parameters. You will need the GeekTool app to run this type of file. Deepness Theme contains some geeklets displaying:

* Your location weather;
* Actual time;
* Battery status;
* Percent of used RAM;
* Percent of used CPU;
* And a light black background for the dock;

Installation:
-------------
1. Open `GeekTool`.
2. Create a `new group` called "Deepness Theme".
3. Open the `geeklets` folder contained in this theme.
4. **IMPORTANT** In order to have the weather status of your location working, you will have to edit the `weather.glet` file and replace `YOURLOCATIONCODE` with the correct information. You will find your location code by searching your city on https://weather.yahoo.com/ . The code will be located at the end of the url https://weather.yahoo.com/canada/quebec/montreal-3534/
4. `Open` every `.glet` file.

Widgets should open at the right location. If not, you can drag them around and place them where they should be.

Now that all the widgets are loaded, check `Automaticaly Launch At Login` and close GeekTool.

You also need to hide the battery percent status and the clock from the menu bar so you don't have redundant information.
