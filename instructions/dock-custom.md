Dock Customization
======================

For the Dock customization, we will make manual modifications but we will also use a software called cDock (cf. README). I would rather prefer to not use third party softs, but in OSX Mavericks, the 3D background of the Dock is generated by the OS. So it is not possible to remove it, that's why we need cDock.

1. Install and open `cDock`.
2. In `Dock Theme`, select `Transparent` and click `Apply`. _The light black full width background will be added later!_
3. Go to `/Systems/Library/CoreServices`, select the `Dock` app, right click and select `Show Package Contents`.
4. Go to `Contents/Resources` and add `_backup` in the name of all the `indicator_` png files.
5. Copy all the images contained in the `elements/dock` folder of the project into the `Contents/Resources` folder. **The new light indicators will be visible once you will have log out.**
