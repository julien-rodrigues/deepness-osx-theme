System Font
======================

1. Launch `Menu Bar Icon` installer. We could use `TinkerTool` but it didn't work for me...
2. When it asks what to install, uncheck everything and check `Helvetica Neue` in the `Fonts` category. **If you didn't buy this font, please consider buying it!** (http://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/neue-helvetica#product_top)
3. Complete installation and restart session.
